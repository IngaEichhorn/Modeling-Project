# Mid-term Project: Modeling on real estate data
Authors: Inga Eichhorn & Nelson Lage

This project was developed for the Data Analytics Course on Ironhack (Berlin campus - Oct2021 Full-time)

**Objectives**:

1. Build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset.
2. Explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tool

**Data**: The data set consists of  historic data of 22,000 properties sold between May 2014 to May 2015.

**Brief description of the work procedure**:

1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
 - Check for outliers
 - Check the data types
 - Check if the values are consistent
 - Check for normality
 - Find correlations

2. Data cleaning
 - Standardize text data
 - Deal with missing values

3. Data transformation
 - Bucketing
 - Standardize the values
 - X/Y split
 - Encode categorical features

4. Modeling
 - Test the model
 - Improve the model based on the values of accuracy

5. Vizualisation
 - Scatter plots to check for correlations
 - Box-plots for outliers
 - Histograms to check how the values are distributed
 - Vizualisation of the regression plot / model
 - Highlight some other interesting patterns in the data
